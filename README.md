VenThatGrant - AI-Powered Grant Management Platform

<b>Overview</b>

VenThatGrant is a comprehensive grant management platform that leverages artificial intelligence to help researchers, nonprofit organizations, and grant seekers find, apply for, and manage funding opportunities. Built on top of the Venice AI API, this application streamlines the entire grant lifecycle from discovery to reporting. Powered by Venice AI and EduChain.

Key Features



Grant Discovery





AI-Powered Grant Matching: Utilizes the Venice AI API to match user profiles with relevant grant opportunities from thousands of funding sources.



Advanced Filtering: Search and filter grants by category, amount, deadline, and more.



Grant Saving: Save interesting grants for later review and application.



Proposal Creation & Optimization





AI-Generated Proposals: Generate compelling research proposals tailored to specific grant requirements.



Proposal Management: Create, edit, and track all your grant proposals in one place.



AI Critique & Optimization: Get expert AI critique of your proposals with analysis of strengths, weaknesses, and suggestions for improvement.



Status Tracking: Monitor proposal status (draft, optimized, submitted) throughout the application process.



Reporting & Compliance





Automated Reports: Generate comprehensive grant reports to meet funder requirements.



Progress Tracking: Track project milestones and outcomes against proposal objectives.



AI-Enhanced Reporting: Leverage AI to create professional, data-driven reports.



AI-Powered Social Promotion





Grant Tweeting Agent: Create an AI agent that automatically tweets about new grant opportunities.



Customizable Promotion: Configure your Twitter agent to match your organization's voice and target specific grant types.



StakeYourGrant

Now ideating towards a staking feature with EduChain where users can stake their grants and potential earn yields of up to 15%

ðŸ§  EduChain Staking: Turning Grants into Growth

The upcoming staking feature on EduChain allows usersâ€”especially students, researchers, or educational creatorsâ€”to stake their awarded grants instead of withdrawing them immediately. By staking, users can potentially earn yields of up to 15% APY, transforming static funding into an active income stream.



ðŸ”’ How It Would Work:





Staking Pool: Once a user receives a grant (in a supported token, e.g., USDC or a native EduChain token), they have the option to lock it into a smart contract.



Flexible or Fixed Duration: Users can choose how long to stakeâ€”perhaps a 3-month, 6-month, or 12-month term, each with corresponding APY tiers.



Yield Source: Yields could be generated via:





Lending protocols (e.g., Aave, Compound)



EduChain ecosystem incentives (such as governance token rewards)



Real-world asset pools (e.g., tokenized T-bills or education-specific DeFi products)



Non-Custodial: Smart contracts ensure users retain control of their funds, and everything remains on-chain and transparent.



Bonus Mechanism: Long-term stakers might earn bonus NFTs or credentials validating their commitment to educational growth.



ðŸŽ“ Why This Matters:





Empowers financial literacy: Users learn how DeFi works in a safe, education-focused context.



Amplifies impact: Grants donâ€™t just sit idleâ€”they grow and can be reinvested into further learning or teaching.



Aligns incentives: Encourages users to stay within the EduChain ecosystem and contribute more value over time.

We will aim to test it out with current and prospective grantholders at our universities - University of Oxford and Imperial College following the whole process from them searching for a grant using VenThatGrant to successfully obtaining the grant to staking the grant powered by EduChain.
